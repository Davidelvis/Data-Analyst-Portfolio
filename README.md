Welcome to my **Data Analyst Portfolio**!  
This repository contains selected data projects that demonstrate my expertise in data generation, analysis, transformation, and reporting using modern analytics tools.

With years of experience working across the analytics stack — from raw data wrangling to interactive dashboards — I’ve built this portfolio to show the depth of my skills, especially where NDA-protected work cannot be shared.
